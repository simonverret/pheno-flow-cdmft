# Normalizing Flows for Phenomenological Model of CDMFT
Research project on phenomenological model of CDMFT results fitted with normalizing flow methods

## Parts of the code

#### `toyfit.py`
Script that replaces CDMFT with an hardcoded model to simply demonstrate the feasability of fitting a phenomenological model to data using pytorch autograd functionalies
